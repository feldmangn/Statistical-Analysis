This collection includes reports I have written on various topics of interest that incorperate statistical analysis. As an analytical chemist, I have always had an affinity towards applying these type of techniques to datasets collected from instruments.

The time series analysis uses ARIMA Models to US Incarceration Rates to project what the prison population may look like in the following years. This analysis was run in R Studio.

The Optical Coherence Tomography paper was written for a graduate course in analytical spectroscopy. This is a review on the application of these techniques to art conservation projects and how they have been used in the field.

Finally, the paper about discretization used a data set collected from a variety of glass samples using FORS. This looked at using various clustering approaches to categorize these glass samples based on their key spectral features.
